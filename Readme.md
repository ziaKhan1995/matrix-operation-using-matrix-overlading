# C++ operator overloading for matrix operations

# Operator Overloading
Given two matrix mat1[][] and mat2[][] of NxN dimensions, the task is to perform Matrix Operations using Operator Overloading.
Examples: 
 
```diff
Input: arr1[][] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {1, 2, 3}}, arr2[][] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 16}, {1, 2, 3}} 
Output: 
Addition of two given Matrices is: 
2 4 6 
8 10 22 
2 4 6 
Subtraction of two given Matrices is: 
0 0 0 
0 0 -10 
0 0 0 
Multiplication of two given Matrices is: 
12 18 44 
30 45 110 
12 18 44 
Input: arr1[][] = { {11, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 0}, {1, 12, 3}}, arr2[][] = { {1, 2, 3}, {41, 5, 16}, {1, 22, 3}} 
Output: 
Addition of two given Matrices is : 
12 4 6 
45 10 16 
2 34 6 
Subtraction of two given Matrices is : 
10 0 0 
-37 0 -16 
0 -10 0 
Multiplication of two given Matrices is : 
96 98 74 
209 33 92 
496 128 204
